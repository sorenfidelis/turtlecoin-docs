# How to contribute to the TurtleCoin wiki

You ideally need to install git _(command line interface needed, none of the GUIs I've used allow access to all the commands being used)_ and be able to push and pull from your repo.
    TODO: Explain how to do that ^^ since that requires whole guides, that isn't be covered here.

Right now that you have access to git and can pull and push to your repos on GitHub let's continue with how to create/update/re-arrange content for the TurtleCoin wiki.

### Hold up I just want to fix a typo

Well in that case simply navigate to the page and click the edit button. Make your fixes and save, which should create a Pull Request (PR) and you're done. Thanks for paying attention to the details!

### Disclaimer

Nothing in this guide is the "right" way, it is simply a "way" that will work 99% of the time and as someone new to the world of git and GitHub, it is going to cut through an almost veritcal learning curve that is git.

As a developer person who is familar with git and wanting to help with docs, you might find the commands part useful for refreshing on how to interact with the wiki git repo that is in GitHub from the code in the actual repo.

This guides purpose is to break down the barrier that exists to get from "I want to write/contribute docs" to "here is my PR". If anything is not clear or could be made clear, please jump into discord #dev_docs channel and chat about it or even go ahead update the doc.

### Defintions

repo = git repository
wiki repo = the git repository that powers the wiki tab in a GitHub repo

GitHub's base thing that we intereact with on the site is a repo. This gets a bit confusing, however once you're familar it no longer casues issues. we can break down the URL and see how it works as well

https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-wiki

turtlecoin = the github user or organisation
turtlecoin-wiki = repo

 

## The commands / wokflow process

These are the commands and the workflow. Further down inthe guide why and explanations and scenarios will be covered. Once understood and you need a reminder of what to do, this is the section you'll be looking for and wanting a quick fix. So it is covered first. Plus
